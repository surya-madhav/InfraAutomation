# Cloud Networking Project
## Abstract
This project is a part of the Cloud Networking course. The project is a simple web application that allows users to register and login. The user receives a verification email upon registration. In this project, I have used Google Cloud Platform services like Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL. The infrastructure is set up using Terraform. The backend is built using Node.js and Express. The project is deployed using GitHub Actions.
